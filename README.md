Maratis Manager
===============

The Maratis Manager is a program that enables you to automatically download and compile the newest version of
the Maratis3D game engine which you can find on http://www.maratis3d.org. 
It is able to retrieve the newest version from the SVN repository and compile it for your very machine,
either 32bit or 64bit. The whole Maratis3D editor and player get installed in the home directory so no
super user rights are necessary. It will also install the SDK for C/C++ development with Maratis3D and allows
easy game plugin creation for new and existing game projects with a convenient one click solution.

Core features: 
==============

- Download and installation of the Maratis3D SVN version 
- Game plugin build system creation 
- Recently used projects list 
- Realtime updated engine output (might need the usage of fflush in the game plugin)
